## Creation of New Test
Our framework is based on the Page Object Model design pattern. 
- If required create paage, create new file in cypress/e2e/pages i.e. wikiPage.js which will extend BasePage.js. 
- Create new folder if not present under cypress/e2e/test for module which test has to be written 
- If module in present , create it block under specific test file.

## Viewing the Results 
 - Once test is run , result will be store in cypress/reports which is html file.
 - Execution video can be located in cypress/videos.
 - To get the CI result view select the pipeline and expand it, then select cypress/run and get into artifact tab.
